These are typical economic indicators, and they often influence each other in the context of financial and stock market behavior.

🔁 General Relationships Between Features
1. Interest Rate ↔ Index Price
📉 Higher interest rates → borrowing becomes expensive → companies invest less → stock market (index price) tends to fall.

📈 Lower interest rates → cheaper loans → more investments → index prices may rise.

➡️ Inverse relationship in many cases.

2. Unemployment Rate ↔ Index Price
📉 High unemployment → weak economy → reduced consumer spending → index prices drop.

📈 Low unemployment → strong economy → more spending → index prices rise.

➡️ Again, a generally negative correlation.

3. Interest Rate ↔ Unemployment Rate
📈 When central banks raise interest rates (to control inflation), it may slow down the economy → could lead to increased unemployment.

📉 When they lower interest rates, it encourages business activity → potentially reduces unemployment.

➡️ Often positively related, depending on economic conditions.

4. Year & Month (Time Features)
These are contextual features — trends change over time.

Over years, economies grow → average index prices might trend upward.

Seasonal effects (months) may affect certain industries, slightly influencing index prices.
