Do we need standardization in decision tree?
No, standardization is not required for Decision Tree models.

✅ Why?
Decision Trees (and tree-based models like Random Forests, Gradient Boosting) are not sensitive to the scale of features. They:
Split data by feature thresholds (e.g., “Is feature ≤ 5.5?”)
Don’t use distance-based calculations (like SVM or KNN do)
Don’t assume features follow a normal distribution
So whether your features are in centimeters or kilometers, the tree structure will be the same.

🧠 When Is Standardization Needed?
Standardization is usually needed for models that depend on feature magnitudes, such as:
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
Neural Networks
